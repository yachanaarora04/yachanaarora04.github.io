## Summary

At Amazon, I build scalable, reliable, and customer-focused systems. Experience spans backend development with **Java**, **TypeScript**, **AWS services**, system design, and performance optimization. I’ve also worked with frontend stacks such as **React** and **Next.js**, cloud-native architectures, and integrations to deliver end-to-end solutions.

I hold a B.Tech in Mathematics and Scientific Computing, with strong foundations in analytics, problem solving, and engineering judgment — enabling me to build robust, secure, and scalable software.
