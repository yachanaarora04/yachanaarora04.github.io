## Correct Posture
**02/2023 â€“ Present**

The widespread use of technology affects posture when using electronic devices. This project explores detection and guidance to improve posture health.

- Researched posture degradation patterns and device-use ergonomics.
- Built data collection scripts and baseline models; explored on-device feedback loops.

> What qualifies as success? Example: measurable reduction in forward-head posture angle across users in a 4-week study.
